The agent successfully showcased key features including the 3D baffle plates, dual suction using a paper demonstration, and the auto-clean cycle timer. He then spent significant time demonstrating the smart features like the recipe guide, multimedia apps, and LPG reminder. Technical issues briefly interrupted the audio and screen interaction. The customer inquired about the price (27K) and indicated satisfaction, but the agent failed to secure a clear next step, allowing the customer to end the call without a commitment.",
    "Agent_Performance_Summary": "Nazeem demonstrated strong product knowledge and executed a visually effective demo. However, his overall performance was hampered by poor audio quality and a complete failure to execute a proper closing, resulting in an open-ended sale.",
    "Customer_Journey_Summary": "The customer was highly motivated (follow-up call, consulted mother) and received all requested product information through a highly visual demo. They appeared satisfied with the product features but ultimately left without a formalized next step, making the journey incomplete.",
    "Business_Recommendation": "Immediate follow-up is necessary to capture this high-intent lead. Standardized training must be implemented to address closing techniques and improve the environment for live video calls to ensure pristine audio quality."
