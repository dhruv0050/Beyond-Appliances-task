Agent Nazeem provided a detailed, visual demonstration covering the filterless design, dual suction power (validated with paper and steam), and smart features like Chef Connect recipes and LPG reminders. The customer confirmed the price and expressed satisfaction with the features. However, the call concluded abruptly without the agent attempting to close the sale or schedule a concrete follow-up, leaving the decision entirely in the customer's hands.",
    "Agent_Performance_Summary": "Nazeem excels in product demonstration and feature knowledge, using props effectively to highlight key benefits. His performance faltered significantly in the closing stage and in the proactive discussion of logistical details such as installation and warranty, which are crucial for converting high-intent leads.",
    "Customer_Journey_Summary": "The customer received a highly informative and engaging product demonstration that addressed her core interests (technology, cleaning). Her positive responses and price confirmation suggest a very strong intention to purchase. The journey lacked a professional handover to the transaction phase, potentially introducing unnecessary delay.",
    "Business_Recommendation": "Given the high intent, Nazeem must receive immediate coaching on closing strategies. The business should prioritize scheduling a firm follow-up call/WhatsApp chat for finalizing the purchase and detailing the installation process, aiming to convert this lead immediately."
