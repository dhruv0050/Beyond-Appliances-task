The customer inquired about the 'Cube Chimney' and its unique features, prompting the agent to deliver an extensive explanation of the 5-stage hydrophobic filter, 4-year warranty, and maintenance-free design. The agent then performed a strong visual and smoke demo of the product, successfully addressing the customer's pain points regarding oily residue and cleaning. After discussing pricing and noise levels, the customer chose to explore online, and the agent offered a personalized WhatsApp follow-up with product details.",
    "Agent_Performance_Summary": "Nazeem displayed high confidence and comprehensive technical product knowledge, enhanced by a professional and impactful demonstration. His ability to address feature-based objections was strong. However, he missed an opportunity for immediate conversion by failing to guide the customer toward closing the discounted online sale and displayed a minor gap in competitive product knowledge.",
    "Customer_Journey_Summary": "The customer moved from initial curiosity to high interest after the product features and demo satisfied their specific maintenance and cleanliness concerns. Although they expressed price sensitivity and confirmed the chimney solves their core problems, they opted for further independent online exploration, marking a highly successful informative stage of the journey.",
    "Business_Recommendation": "The agent must be coached on closing techniques to convert high-intent customers who have received all necessary information. The immediate follow-up via WhatsApp is critical to securing the sale before the customer navigates to a competitor."
